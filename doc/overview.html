The Robot Mapper classes provide a general framework for mapping an environment
using a robot, specifically an environment mapped over a probabilistic occupancy grid using a
sonar-based Pioneer 2-AT robot.  It supports command line and library execution; 
off-line (recorded) and on-line (live) map construction and viewing;
on-board and wireless operation; as well simulated and real-world environments.
Robot Mapper also serves as the engine (in its DLL form) to the Java-based Map Viewer application,
which is documented separately.

\section org Organization

The classes, structures and namespaces that compose the Robot Mapper suite 
fall into three broad categories, listed and diagrammed below.  
The diagram also shows inheritance relationships, with arrows pointing to
superclasses.

<!--table border=0><tr valign=top>
<td>
<ul>
<li><b>Utility</b>:  RmUtility, RmExceptions, RmMutableMatrix, RmMutableCartesianGrid
<li><b>Robot Interface</b>: RmPioneerController, RmActionHook, RmActionHandler, RmSonarMapper
<li><b>Mapping</b>: RmSonarMap, RmBayesCertaintyGrid, RmGlobalMap, RmLocalMap, RmBayesSonarModel
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Utility</b>:  RmUtility, RmExceptions, RmMutableMatrix, RmMutableCartesianGrid
<li><b>Robot Interface</b>: RmPioneerController, RmActionHook, RmActionHandler, RmSonarMapper
<li><b>Mapping</b>: RmSonarMap, RmBayesCertaintyGrid, RmGlobalMap, RmLocalMap, RmBayesSonarModel
</ul>

<center><img src="classDiagram.jpg"></center>

With the exception of RmUtility::SonarReading (which depends on the ArRobot and ArPose
classes documented in the Aria API), the utility classes are independent of any specific 
application.  The Robot Interface classes are specific to the ActivMedia Aria API and Pioneer 2-AT,
which provide a single-step robot initialization and sonar collection and recording mechanism.
The Mapping classes provide the Bayesian occupancy grid sonar mapping and localization functionality.

There are three source files included within RmMapper 
that have functions and definitions outside the scope of a class, structure,
or namespace, and thus aren't included in this documentation.
These are src/main.cpp (the main application), src/client.cpp (the wireless client
application), and src/RmJavaGridModel.cpp (the Java native interface bridge between 
RmMapper and the separate graphical Java map viewer).
The source code for all of these is available via the File List link at the top of the page.

\section start Program Flow
While the previous section briefly describes the hierarchical class structure,
this section focuses on program flow over five different modes of operation.

The modes have to do with whether sonar data processed is live or static,
and for live data, whether the robot or simulator is operated locally or remotely.
Additionally, the map viewer may build maps using static or live data, both
remotely or locally.

<ol>
<li>Live local: a map is built using live data from the robot or simulator 
via onboard or directly connected mapping software
<li>Static local: a map is built using pre-recorded static sonar data
<li>Live remote:  a map is built using live data from the robot or simulator
over a wireless UDP connection
<li>Static local viewer:  a map is simultaneously built and viewed using pre-recorded static sonar data
<li>Live remote viewer:  a map is simultaneously built and viewed using live data from the robot 
or simulator over a wireless UDP connection
</ol>

The below diagram illustrates these and several other relationships, to include
operational, functional, controlling process, inheritance, and process flow.

The first three operational modes are represented in the below by the three controlling process 
circles labeled "Mapper Live", "Mapper Static", and "Mapper Remote".
All three of these are elements of src/main.cpp. 
The remaining two modes, which overlay the map viewer functionality, 
are identified by the display symbols labeled "Viewer Static" and "Viewer Remote Client".
These are elements of viewer/src/MapViewer.java.

There are also six distinct functional regions shown in the diagram.  
The large yellow area encompasses all the software within RmMapper that is responsible for
acquiring data and building a map.  
Within that region, the live local flow is shaded in burgandy;
the static local flow is shaded in blue;
the live remote flow and live remote viewer flow are shaded in red; 
and the static local viewer flow is shaded in green.
Finally, those elements that fall outside the yellow region altogether are those that are
external to the RmMapper application.

<!--table cellpadding=0 cellpadding=5 border=0><tr>
<td valign=top-->

Controlling processes, as mentioned, are shown as circles. 
Those circles drawn as an arrow contain a main control loop; those that are shaded are
console applications.  
Mapper Live, which doesn't utilize a control loop, creates an
RmPioneerController object that itself performs all the mapping functionality, while
src/main.cpp blocks until that object completes its task and is destroyed
(see mapFromRobot() in src/main.cpp).
Those processes that overlap an object indicate those processes <i>are</i> that object.
For example, the Robot Sim process, which represents the robot or simulator, is
actually encapsulated within, and therefore is, an RmPioneerController object.

Objects are further illustrated with nesting, which indicates inheritance relationships.
For example, an RmGlobalMap <i>is</i> an RmBayesCertaintyGrid, which <i>is</i>, in turn,
an RmMutableCartesianGrid, etc.  The unique relationship between an RmGlobalMap and
RmLocalMap is shown through adjacency and multiplicity:  an RmGlobalMap is composed of
multiple RmLocalMap objects.

Process flow is shown using arrows.  The starting end of the arrow identifies the calling
object; the terminating end, the object being called.  If a method is identified on the
line, it is that of the called object.  For example, RmSonarMapper, in the middle of the diagram,
calls RmServer::sendClientReply().  
Methods that utilize a return value are shown with a diamond on the calling object,
and the return value follows the method name, with a colon separating them.  
For example, RmJavaGridModel, in the green
region, calls RmSonarMapper::mapReading() and expects a map string in response.  This is then
passed back to Viewer Static as its return value for stepSonarMapper().
Dashed arrows indicate wireless communication.

As an example that ties all this together, 
consider the live remote viewer mode, where the robot is controlled
wirelessly and the map is built in real-time, also on a wireless console.
Three applications are executed in this case:  the server on the robot, Mapper Remote
(bin/Mapper.exe); and two on the client, bin/MapperClient.exe and viewer/bin/MapViewer.class.
Once handshakes have been exchanged between the server and the two clients,
the user controls the robot via the console shown in the lower right hand side of the diagram.
These key controls are acquired by Client, and communicated wirelessly via RmClient to the 
Control RmServer on Mapper Remote, which then translates the control into a motion command
and forwards it on to the robot (or simulator), Robot Sim (an RmPioneerController), 
using the Aria object ArActionKeydrive.
While the robot is physically responding to the command, the Pioneer
is sending sonar data to RmSonarMapper via the Aria API's call to fire() 
RmSonarMapper::handleAction().
RmSonarMapper saves the sonar data to a *.sd file, and asks RmGlobalMap to update the
map using that data.  RmGlobalMap returns the map update string, which RmSonarMapper gives to
the Viewer RmServer within Mapper Remote.  Mapper Remote then sends the string wirelessly 
back to Viewer Remote Client.  Finally, the viewer processes the map string and updates the 
map display accordingly.

\section build Builds and Dependencies
This section contains build-specific information that is independent of the
classes and other structures that compose the RmMapper application, but is provided
as a description of the environment and configuration used for compilation and build.

\subsection paths Paths
The following paths should be included in the PATH environment variable
(set via System Properties - Advanced - Environment Variables):
<ul>
<li>C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.5.0\\bin
<li>C:\\Program Files\\ActivMedia Robotics\\Aria-2.1-1\\bin
<li>..\\Mapper\\bin
</ul>

\subsection projects Projects
The RmMapper workspace is divided up
into five projects.  Two of these correspond to the client
and server control applications, and three are the libraries that provide the mapping
functionality:

</table>

\subsection config IDE Configuration
The application is compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 (build attempts with
.NET were unsuccessful), linked with Aria 2.1.1, and integrated with the graphical
map viewer written using Java 1.5.0.  

Visual C++ configuration is given by the following:

Dependencies are established for each project that isn't a static library
in the Object/library modules
field in the Link tab of Project Properties.  Shown in the image are those dependencies
specific to the main application, MapperCon.  MapperClient is not dependent upon
Aria.lib or ../lib/Polygon.lib.  MapperDll is not dependent upon ../lib/Mapper.lib.

<center><img src="projectSettingsLink.jpg"></center>

Visual C++ is also configured to look in specific directories for any include 
or library files, as shown:

<center>
<img src="libraryDirectories.jpg"><br>
<img src="includeDirectories.jpg">
</center>

\section usage Usage
While the commands issued at the command line are dependent upon the build setups,
this documentation assumes:
<ul>
<li>src/client.cpp is built as MapperClient.exe (Client)
<li>src/main.cpp is built as Mapper.exe (Server)
<li>src/viewer.bat is a batch file that executes the Java viewer application
</ul>

There are three mapping modes supported by Mapper.exe:
<ul>
<li>Pre-recorded:  ..\\bin> Mapper -si &lt;filename&gt; [-g &lt;gridFilename&gt;]
<li>Live local: ..\\bin> Mapper -so[o] &lt;filename&gt; [-g &lt;gridFilename&gt;]
<li>Live remote:  This involves the simultaneous execution of a server (robot drive)
and at least two client consoles (robot control and map viewer).  
For simulation, all three can be executed on the same machine;
for real-world, the server must be executed on the robot, and the clients on
a wirelessly connected computer.  A sample execution sequence follows.
